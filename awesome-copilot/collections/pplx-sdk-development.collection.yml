      This agent provides expert guidance for pplx-sdk development.

      This agent is ideal for:
      - Implementing new features following the five-layer architecture
      - Writing SSE streaming integrations with reconnection logic
      - Ensuring mypy --strict compliance across the codebase
      - Scaffolding new modules with proper typing and tests
      - Reviewing code for layer boundary violations

      To get the best results, consider:
      - Using the instruction file to set context for pplx-sdk conventions
      - Using the scaffold prompt to generate new module boilerplate
      - Switching to the expert agent for detailed implementation help
      - Specifying which architecture layer you are working in
